# Dwight McNeil

Dwight was valued at $250,000 when he burst onto the scene 4 years ago.

After a great first season his value increased by 50%. Being a top performer in Burnley's European season saw it increase again by 200%. That's when Juventus showed interest in him.

A quiet 2nd half of the 2021 season andthe  majority of the 2022 season saw his value drop by 50%.

Luckily for the Burnley chairman now that we've been relegated, a great final 8 games saw it go up again by 40%.

What can a mid-table premier league club now purchase Dwight for?

This price includes VAT (GST) at 20%. What is Dwight's price excluding VAT?
